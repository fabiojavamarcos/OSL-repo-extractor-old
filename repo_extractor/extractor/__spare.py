#     Create a dict of contributors and their contributions.
#
#     The project is interested in determining the core contributors for a
#     given repository. To do this, we have implemented the algorithm
#     discussed in Coelho et al., 2018 (see citation below) wherein the
#     contributors whose sum commits are 80% of the total commits for the
#     repo are aggregated and those from that group who have less than five
#     commits are disregarded. This implementation is found in the OSL
#     metrics aggregator. This method creates a dict of all contributors,
#     descendingly ordered by total commits, for input into the Coelho et
#     al. custom "Commit-Based Heuristic" algorithm.
